The question: imagine a scaling matrix model, in the sense that
the matrix $M$ and coupling $g$ scale with $N$ in a simple way.
Along this scaling, the physical observables are kept invariant.
If such a scaling phenomenon exists, what can we say about the
physical observables around such critical point?

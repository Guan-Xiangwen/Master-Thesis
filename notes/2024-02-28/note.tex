One crucial idea for analyzing the matrix model is to reduce the number of variables from $N^2$ to $N$.
This can be done because of the symmetry of the model.
What's the physical insight follows from this reduction?
If one interpret the matrix as a Hamiltonian, the reduction is essentially chosing the energy eigen-basis for the physical states.
The symmetry is just the fact that the physical observables do not depend on the choice of basis.
However, we would like to take about the matrix model arising in the string theory.
There, rather than an operator on the space of physical states,
the matrix itself represents the physical states: the Chan-Paton degrees of freedom of open string.

The number of the Hermitian matrices matches the number of the Chan-Paton degrees of freedom.
